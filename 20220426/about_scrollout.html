            <h1 class="title">Articles fading in</h1>
            <p>
                The presence of reflectors in the environment surrounding a transmitter and receiver create multiple paths that a transmitted signal can traverse. 
                As a result, the receiver sees the superposition of multiple copies of the transmitted signal, each traversing a different path. 
                Each signal copy will experience differences in attenuation, delay and phase shift while traveling from the source to the receiver. This can result in either constructive or destructive interference, amplifying or attenuating the signal power seen at the receiver. 
                Strong destructive interference is frequently referred to as a deep fade and may result in temporary failure of communication due to a severe drop in the channel signal-to-noise ratio.
                A common example of deep fade is the experience of stopping at a traffic light and hearing an FM broadcast degenerate into static,
                 while the signal is re-acquired if the vehicle moves only a fraction of a meter. The loss of the broadcast is caused by the vehicle stopping at a point 
                 where the signal experienced severe destructive interference. Cellular phones can also exhibit similar momentary fades.
                Fading channel models are often used to model the effects of electromagnetic transmission of information over the air in cellular networks and 
                broadcast communication. Fading channel models are also used in underwater acoustic communications to model the distortion caused by the water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Selective fading or frequency selective fading is a radio propagation anomaly caused by partial cancellation of a radio signal by itself — 
                the signal arrives at the receiver by two different paths, and at least one of the paths is changing (lengthening or shortening). 
                This typically happens in the early evening or early morning as the various layers in the ionosphere move, separate, and combine. 
                The two paths can both be skywave or one be groundwave.
                Selective fading manifests as a slow, cyclic disturbance; the cancellation effect, or "null", is deepest at one particular frequency, 
                which changes constantly, sweeping through the received audio.
                As the carrier frequency of a signal is varied, the magnitude of the change in amplitude will vary. 
                The coherence bandwidth measures the separation in frequency after which two signals will experience uncorrelated fading.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fading can cause poor performance in a communication system because it can result in a loss of signal power without reducing the power of the noise. 
                This signal loss can be over some or all of the signal bandwidth. Fading can also be a problem as it changes over time: communication systems are often designed to adapt to such impairments, but the fading can change faster than the adaptations can be made. In such cases, 
                the probability of experiencing a fade (and associated bit errors as the signal-to-noise ratio drops) on the channel becomes the limiting factor in the link's performance.
                The effects of fading can be combated by using diversity to transmit the signal over multiple channels that experience independent fading 
                and coherently combining them at the receiver. The probability of experiencing a fade in this composite channel is then proportional to the probability 
                that all the component channels simultaneously experience a fade, a much more unlikely event.

            <h1 class="title">Character splitting</h1>
            <p>
                ‘Splitting’ is common symptom for people with mental health issues like borderline personality disorder (BPD). 
                Splitting means to divide something. it causes A person to view everything and everyone in black and white, ‘absolute’ terms. 
                It stops them from being able to recognise or accept paradoxical qualities in someone or something and doesn’t allow for any ‘grey areas’ in their thinking. 
                Splitting is a defence mechanism deployed by people with BPD and other personality disorders. 
                It's development can be linked to experiences of early life traumas, such as abuse and abandonment. 
            <p>
                Seeing and responding to the world in these extremes, through either a filter of positivity or negativity, 
                can leave a person with BPD exhausted and emotionally drained. It can also lead to strains or fractures in their relationships 
                as those close to the person become more and more affected by their behaviour.   
                commonly used defense mechanism that is done subconsciously in an attempt to protect against intense negative feelings such as loneliness, abandonment and isolation.

            <h1 class="title">Colors changing</h1>
            <p>
                In HTML, we can change the color of any text using the following different ways:

                Using HTML tag
                Using an Inline style attribute
                Using internal CSS
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Using HTML tag</p>
            <p>

                Note: HTML 5 does not support the color attribute of font, so we have to use the inline style attribute and internal CSS
                options for changing the color of a text.
                If we want to change the color of a text using Html tag which is to be displayed on a web page,
                we have to follow the steps which are given below. Using these steps, we can easily change the color of any text:
            </p>
            <p>
                Step 1: Firstly, we have to type the Html code in any text editor or open the existing Html file in the text editor in
            which we want to use the Html tag.</p>
            <p>
            Step 2: Now, move the cursor at the starting of that text whose color we want to change. And then, type the empty Html
            <font> tag at that position.</p>
                <p>Step 3: Then, we have to close the font tag at the end of the text whose color we want to change.</p>
                <p>Step 4: Now, we have to add the attribute of the font tag whose name is "color". So, type the color attribute within
                the starting <font> tag. And, then we have to give the color which we want to use on the text. So, type the name of
                color in the color attribute as described in the following block.</p>
                <p>Step 5: And, at last, we have to save the Html code in the text editor and run the code. After execution, we
                will see the output in the browser. The following screenshot shows the output of the above Html Code:
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Using an Inline Style attribute</p>
            <p>

                If we want to change the color of a text using an inline style attribute which is to be displayed on a web page, we have
                to follow the steps which are given below. Using these steps, we can easily change the color of text.
            </p>
            <p>
                Step 1: Firstly, we have to type the Html code in any text editor or open the existing Html file in the text editor in
                which we want to use the style attribute for changing the color of a text.</p>
            <p>
                Step 2: Now, move the cursor at the starting of that text whose color we want to change. And then, type the inline style
                attribute within any element. Here, we use the <p> (paragraph) tag:</p>
                <p>Step 3: Then, we have to close the font tag at the end of the text whose color we want to change.</p>
                <p>a. We can also enter the RGB value of a color</p>
                <p>b. We can also enter the hexadecimal value of a color.</p>
                <p>c. We can type the name of a color</p>

                <p>Step 4: Then, we have to close the element at the end of the text whose color we want to change.</p>
                <p>Step 5: And, at last, save the Html code which changes the text color using the CSS style attribute.
            </p>

            <p>
                3. Using Internal CSS</p>
            <p>

                If we want to change the color of a text using an internal cascading stylesheet which is to be displayed on a web page,
                we have to follow the steps which are given below. Using these steps, we can easily change the color of text.
            </p>
            <p>
                Step 2: Now, we have to place the cursor in the head tag of the Html document and then define the styles inside the "style"
                    tag as shown in the following block. And,
                    then type the color attribute into the element selector..</p>
            <p>
                Step 2: Now, move the cursor at the starting of that text whose color we want to change. And then, type the inline style
                attribute within any element. Here, we use the <p> (paragraph) tag:</p>
                <p>Step 3: Now, we have to type the defined element selector before the text whose color we want to change.</p>
